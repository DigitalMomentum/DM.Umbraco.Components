# DM.Umbraco.Components

All Components avaliable on MyGet Feed: https://www.myget.org/F/digital-momentum/api/v3/index.json

## Image Button
* Myget: DigitalMomentum.Umbraco.ImageButton
* Type: DocType / Grid Property Editor

Allows creating an image with text Overlay (Heading and description) and link to Content / Media node

Note: Most of the credit for My Image Button goes to [Skrift](http://skrift.io/articles/archive/how-to-create-custom-editors-for-the-umbraco-grid/) and [Anders Bjerner from Skybrud.dk](https://www.skybrud.dk/) as I have only made a minor change adding a link picker. Thier original code can be found on [github](https://github.com/abjerner/GridEditorsDemo)
